**This project is abandoned. Feel free to ask me to transfer ownership.**

(Unlike many others of my projects which have not had any activity in years, there is zero percent chance that I will ever pick it up again.)

This is a free web API for finding reposts on [Ruqqus](https://github.com/ruqqus/ruqqus).

It currently supports only images, and it uses [Emgu's wrapper](http://www.emgu.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) for [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to compare images.

It supports ONLY jpeg and png images. It does not support:
- GIFs
- MP4s
- Imgur albums
- Imgur GIFVs
- Gfycat posts
- Flickr posts

In the near future, this may be supported.

There is currently no public instance, and there will be no public instance unless someone comes up with funding.
